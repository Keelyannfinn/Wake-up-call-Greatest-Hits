This project is a response to the very common and often overlooked issue that many people suffer with, which is sleeping through alarms. It may not sound like a real-world problem, but waking up in the morning is a necessity, and for some people, a major struggle that impacts their entire day. 

These coded musical alarms focus on the idea that music is a stimulant to the brain. They are a series of morning alarm sounds that mimic generational hits. In the hopes of benefiting people who struggle to wake up to generic alarm sounds. 

My coded alarm songs take on my own rendition, cut down to capture the catchy, most known melodyies. While the main melody sounds like the original, I created the backup/supporting sounds myself to what I felt best suited the melody and function as an alarm sound, hence why the renditions sound different from the originals. 

**Instructions**: 
There are four songs attached under INSERT FOLDER. These are my final four coded songs following four generational hits
1. As It Was
2. Shape of You
3. You Belong With Me
4. Blinding Lights

Within this folder, there is additional **Tunepad songs/Info** as well as past versions. 

To further understand the project; 

1. Watch my **Video walkthrough**

2. Ensure that when listening to my alarm codes, the volume levels are correct (see below)
