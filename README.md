This project is a response to the very common and often overlooked issue that many people suffer with, which is sleeping through alarms. It may not sound like a real-world problem, but waking up in the morning is a necessity, and for some people, a major struggle that impacts their entire day. 

These coded musical alarms focus on the idea that music is a stimulant to the brain. They are a series of morning alarms sounds that mimic generational hits. In the hopes of benefitting people who struggle to wake up to generic alarm sounds. 

**Instructions**: 
There are four songs attached under INSERT FOLDER. These are my Final four coded songs following four generational hits
1. As It Was
2. You belong with me
3. Shape of you
4. Blinding Lights

Within this folder there is additional **information** as well as past versions.
